These resources are intended to guide a SIEM team to...
* ... develop a workflow for content creation (and retirement) in the SIEM and other security tools.
* ... illustrate detection coverage provided and highlight coverage gaps as goals to fill.
* ... eliminate or add additional layers of coverage based on organizational needs.
* Ensure proper logs are generated and recorded for sufficient detection, investigation, and compliance.

# Preparation, Prerequisites, etc.
Without covering the basics, there isn't much point in having a SIEM. Harden your environment and configure appropriate auditing on all endpoints.

# [Detection Tactics](/Detection-Tactics.md)

To detect an attacker, one must be equipped with the necessary logs to reveal their activities. Here we use a matrix to map detection tactics to attacker tactics ([Mitre ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)).


# [Detection Methods](/Detection-Methods.md)

Once necessary logs are collected (detection tactics), use various methods to reveal anomalous, suspicious, and malicious activity.


# Playbooks

Playbooks provide a means to document solutions for many reasons including tracking work, uniform response, content recreation, metrics & reporting, making informed decisions, avoiding work duplication, and more.

# Data Enrichment

These efforts can provide significant benefits to some ingested logs. Typically enrichment will result in either adding a new field to events or a lookup table for use in filtering or filling in a field.

- GeoIP/ASN Lookup
- Levenshtein Distance
- Shannon Entropy Scores
- String Lengths
- Top 1 Million Domains
- WHOIS Caching
- DNS Lookup
- Reverse-DNS Lookup

# [Lab](/Lab/WindowsVictim.md)
Set up a lab with a Windows system, a SIEM, and an attacking system to aid in detection research and development.


# TODO
- [ ] Add Use Case Examples
- [ ] Add Threat Hunts Library
- [ ] Add an object oriented, relational database approach to recording and associating all elements to one another - cases, adversaries, techniques, mitigations, detections, hunts, log sources, etc.
