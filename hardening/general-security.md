# Apply defense-in-depth principles
- By using multiple layers of security to ensure comprehensive analysis and detection of possible intrusions.

# Establish baselines of network traffic, application execution, and account authentication. 
- Use these baselines to enforce an "allowlist" philosophy rather than denying known-bad IOCs. Ensure monitoring and detection tools and procedures are primarily behavior-based, rather than IOC-centric.

# Eliminate Default Passwords
- And the use of the same password for each account created manually and/or via scripts.
