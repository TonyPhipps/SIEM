Risk Based Alerting (RBA) is a security framework that stops teams from alerting on events (single bad things) and starts alerting on risk (patterns of dangerous behavior). Instead of treating every suspicious action as an immediate emergency, RBA records them as "observations," assigns them a score, and only alerts the SOC when the total score for a user or system crosses a dangerous threshold.

Three Major Benefits
- Silence the Noise: Reduces alert volume by 50–90% by filtering out isolated "false positives" (like a user mistyping a password once).
- Catch "Low & Slow" Attacks: Detects sophisticated attackers who move slowly to avoid triggering traditional loud alarms.
- Full Context: When an alert finally fires, the analyst receives a complete "story" (a timeline of 5-10 events), not just a single puzzle piece.


# The Core Analogy: The Motion Sensor vs. The Watchman
Signature-Based (Traditional): You have a motion sensor in every room. If the cat walks through the living room, the alarm goes off. If a window rattles, the alarm goes off. The homeowner (the Analyst) is woken up 50 times a night. Eventually, they stop checking the alarm (Alert Fatigue/Complacency).

Risk-Based (RBA): You have a smart system. It notices the window rattled (Risk Score +10), but ignores it. Later, it sees a motion sensor trip in the hallway (+20). Then, it detects the back door opening at 3 AM (+50). The total score is 80. The system wakes the homeowner and says, "Someone rattled the window, walked down the hall, and opened the door."


# Risk Rules (RR)
These rules highlight observations that may be of interest to Cybersecurity personnel. This typically includes things you would never write a rule for, but would look for in an investigation. Examples include new user creation, newly observed executables, or command-line usage that could be mapped to admin/hacker activity.

An event generated by a Risk Rule will include properties like time, host, user, signature name, risk score, raw event source, raw event sourcetype, and possibly the raw events themselves.


# Risk Incident Rules (RIR)
A Risk Incident Rule is the threshold logic that converts a collection of suspicious behaviors (recorded by Risk Rules) into a single, high-fidelity alert.


# Base Risk Scoring
The following are recommended risk scores for a setup where a RR triggering creates a new event and can assign a score to it.
- 1 - Informational - Innocence is Plausible (Common user behavior)
- 2 - Low - Innocence is Plausible (Uncommon for users, common for admins)
- 4 - Medium - Innocence is Plausible (Rare for users, uncommon for admins)
- 8 - High - Innocence is Unlikely (Probably evil for users, rare for admins)
- 16 - Critical - Innocence is Impossible (Known Evil)


# Risk Score Multipliers
- Multipliers are based on criticality of the "risk object" (Assets and/or Identities)
- One or two lookups that allow dynamically seting system vs user priority based on various properties
  - 1x - Normal risk object (normal user/host, no change)
  - 2x - Privileged risk object (admin's user or workstation)
  - 4x - Critical risk object (service accounts, servers)
  - 8x - "Crown Jewels" risk object (domain admin, DCs)


# Comparisons


## Reducing Alert Fatigue (The "Noise" Problem)
The greatest enemy of a SOC is not the hacker; it's Analyst Burnout. In the signature-basd approach, if Event A happens, trigger Alert A, quickly leading to thousands of alerts per day. Analysts spend their entire shift closing "False Positives" (e.g., a user mistyping their password), while likely missing true positives in the noise. WIth RBA, Risk Rules with scoring built into them are collected as events/"observations" rather than alerts. No alerts are fired, nobody is informed until other conditions are met. Conditions typically include a hard threshold based on a rolling time window or a spike based on average risk scoring for the associated Risk Object (asset/identity). This result in a 90%+ reduction in alert volume, but the alerts that do fire are high-fidelity and require immediate attention.


## Context and Narrative (The "Dot Connecting" Problem)
Attacks rarely happen as a single, isolated event. They are a chain of actions (The Kill Chain). In the signature-based approach, an analyst sees an alert for "PowerShell Execution." Ten minutes later, they see "Unusual File Download." Another analyst sees "New Admin User Created." These are treated as three separate tickets, often worked by three different people who never connect the dots. RBA aggregates these events under a single Risk Object and presents the analyst with a timeline: User X ran PowerShell, downloaded a file, and created an admin. The analyst receives a complete story (a narrative), not just a puzzle piece.


## Detecting "Low and Slow" Attacks
Sophisticated attackers know how to evade signatures. They use "Living off the Land" (LoL) techniques—using tools already installed on the computer (like Excel or PowerShell) to do bad things. In the signature-based approach: You cannot alert on every PowerShell execution, or the SOC would collapse. Therefore, you often have to turn off these signatures or tune them so loosely they miss the attack. With RBA, a low risk score is assigned to "PowerShell Execution." It won't trigger an alert on its own. But if that low-risk event happens alongside other low-risk events (like accessing a sensitive database), the cumulative score triggers the alert. RBA therefore catches subtle, sophisticated attackers that fly under the radar of traditional signatures.
