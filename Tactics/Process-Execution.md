# Process Execution Use Cases

This use case is purposefully separated from commandline activity. These detections assume you have all process execution details other than commandline (process name, PID, full path, etc.)

Grouped by [Detection Method](/Detection-Methods.md)

MITRE ATT&CK Framework: 

- Observe general process execution with the goal of understanding normal and detecting anomalies. Use of multiple visualizations, tables, and aggregation methods is recommended. Any confirmed malicious behavior from this use case should be considered as a foundation for a new alert.

# Log Source Examples
- Windows Security Event ID 4688
  - Secpol.exe > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > System Audit Policies > Detailed Traking > Audit Process Creation: Enabled, Success
  - gpedit.msc > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Audit Process Creation > Include command line in process creation events: Enabled

# Possible False Positives
- Generally a lot of false positives can be expected from this log source. Understanding normal operating system, trusted application, user norms, and business norms is expected to efficiently tune down noise over time.
