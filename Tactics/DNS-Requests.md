## Rolling Whitelist Alert
- Newly Observed Domain
- Newly observed Source Process


## Shannon Entropy Score Alert
- High-Entropy Domain Name
- High-Entropy TXT Queries (RCODE:16)


## Threshold Alert
- Requests where type=TXT and TXT field length exceeds X characters (filter by RCODE=16)
- Number of requests from a single system exceeds X amount in Y time (aggregate on fields: source system)
- Number of requests with DNS Type TXT from a single system exceeds X amount in Y time (aggregate on fields: source system; filter by RCODE=16)
- Number of requests with DNS Type NULL from a single system exceeds X amount in Y time (aggregate on fields: source system; filter by RCODE=10)
- Number of requests with DNS Type CNAME from a single system exceeds X amount in Y time (aggregate on fields: source system; filter by RCODE=5)
- Number of DNS request volume for multiple sub domains of a single parent domain exceeds x amount in Y time (aggregate on fields: source system) (T1520)
- Parent domain text length exceeds X characters
- Number of responses with code SERVFAIL to a single system exceeds X amount in Y time (aggregate on fields: source system; filter by RCODE=2)
- Number of responses with code NXDOMAIN to a single system exceeds X amount in Y time (aggregate on fields: source system; filter by RCODE=3)
- Number of responses with code REFUSED to a single system exceeds X amount in Y time (aggregate on fields: source system; filter by RCODE=5)


## Deviation from Baseline Alarm
- Deviation in Requests for DNS Type TXT
- Deviation in Requests for DNS Type NULL
- Deviation in Requests for DNS Type CNAME
- Deviation in Response Code NXDOMAIN
- Deviation in Response Code SERVFAIL
- Deviation in Response Code REFUSED
